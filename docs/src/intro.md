# Introduction

`ACGui` provides a simple web interface for the `ACFlow` package, which is a state-of-the-art analytic continuation toolkit in Julia. `ACGui` is written in Julia as well. It is based on the `Dash` web framework.

Now `ACGui` supports the following features:

* Three analytic continuation solvers: MaxEnt, BarRat, and StochPX.
* Visualize the spectral functions on line.
* Generate `ac.toml` automatically.
* Flexible UI.
* Easy to install.
