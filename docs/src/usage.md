# Usage

It is quite easy to use `ACGui`.

## Launch ACGui

Suppose that the `ACGui` is placed in the folder `/home/your_home/acgui`, then we should execute the following command in the terminal to launch the server side of `ACGui`:

```shell
$ pwd
/home/your_home/acgui
$ ./util/acg.jl
[ Info: Listening on: 127.0.0.1:8848, thread id: 1
```

Next, we can use any favourite web browsers (such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) to open the following URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8848
```

This is the client side of `ACGui`.
